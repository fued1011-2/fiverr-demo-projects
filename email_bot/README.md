# Email Bot ðŸ¤–ðŸ“¨

This project is an **AI-powered Gmail assistant** that automatically:
- Fetches new emails from your Gmail inbox
- Keeps track of past email threads
- Uses Hugging Face models (free tier) to generate polite and professional replies
- Sends responses via Gmail
- Labels handled emails with `AI_Replied` to avoid double replies

âœ… Conversation history saved locally (`email_history.json`)
